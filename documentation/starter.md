# Project Documentation

## 1. **Strategy and Vision**
   - **Overview**:
     - This project explores whether a software application can be developed by de-emphasizing code-writing while still achieving quality and utility. 
     - Inspired by iterative philosophy paper writing, the goal is to create rapid, functional drafts that evolve through iteration and structured engineering practices.
   - **Core Idea**:
     - The process prioritizes **productivity, iteration, and solid engineering practices** over immediate code perfection.
     - Tools like LLMs and automation assist in creating, refining, and testing.
   - **Hypothesis**:
     - By focusing on rapid development with feedback loops, the project can allocate more time to strategic improvements, such as:
       - Implementing design patterns.
       - Enhancing system architecture.
       - Rest and creative problem-solving.

## 2. **Roadmap**

### **What I Have Done So Far**
   - **Set the Foundation**:
     - Defined the scope and goals of the project.
     - Established core processes and workflows for LLM integration.
   - **Initial Implementations**:
     - Developed basic application functionality.
     - Experimented with LLM-assisted coding for specific features.
     - Ensured a "human-in-the-loop" approach to maintain alignment with project goals.
   - **Iterative Progress**:
     - Prioritized testing, logging, and usability over polished code.
     - Leveraged rapid iteration to identify and fix weaknesses.

### **What I Want to Do Next**
   - **Short-Term Goals**:
     - Refactor key modules to improve maintainability.
     - Implement robust logging and monitoring systems.
     - Design and execute initial user feedback loops.
   - **Medium-Term Goals**:
     - Develop modular, scalable components to prepare for feature expansion.
     - Integrate additional tools and APIs for extended functionality.
     - Automate testing processes for faster iteration cycles.
   - **Long-Term Goals**:
     - Create a framework for ongoing collaboration with LLMs in various software projects.
     - Explore real-world applications of the software.
