# Pipeline Engine Application

## Overview

This application is built around a modular **pipeline engine** that controls the flow of data through a series of distinct stages, each responsible for a transformation that prepares the data for final output. The pipeline engine incorporates "stage gate" validators at each step to ensure data quality, stopping the flow if any issues are detected. This design is inspired by the metaphor of a dam, where data (like water) flows through controlled channels, with each gate able to block the flow if standards are not met.

Each component within the pipeline engine serves a specific function, enabling a flexible and transparent process from input to output. By managing data flow through well-defined stages and quality checkpoints, the pipeline engine guarantees that only validated, meaningful data reaches the end user.

## Core Stages

The pipeline engine operates through three main stages:

1. **Query Creation**: The pipeline begins by transforming the user’s input into a structured query that aligns with the requirements of the search engine. This stage ensures that the query is correctly formatted to yield relevant results.

2. **Search Engine**: The generated query is passed to the search engine, which retrieves a list of relevant web results. This stage provides raw data that is then evaluated for relevance and quality.

3. **Summarization**: In the final stage, the search results are summarized into a concise, user-friendly format. This ensures that the user receives only the most relevant and meaningful information, distilled from the raw data returned by the search engine.

## Stage Gate Validation

To ensure high data quality at every step, **validators** act as "stage gates." These validation steps verify the integrity and relevance of data, similar to checkpoints in a controlled pipeline. If data does not meet the required standards at any stage, the flow stops, effectively "raising the dam wall" to prevent low-quality data from progressing.

Key validations include:

- **Query Validation**: Ensures that the query aligns with quality standards and is likely to yield useful results.
- **Result Validation**: Assesses the search results, confirming their relevance and quality before passing the data to the summarization stage.

By catching potential issues early, these stage gates help maintain the quality and relevance of the output.

## Benefits of the Architecture

1. **Clarity and Maintainability**: With explicit naming conventions and a clear directory structure, each component’s purpose is immediately recognizable, making the application easy to navigate and maintain.
2. **Reliability**: Stage gates ensure that data quality issues are caught early, enhancing the accuracy and relevance of the final output.
3. **Flexibility**: The modular structure allows for easy adjustments. New stages or validators can be added with minimal impact on the existing system.
4. **User-Centric Design**: By focusing on meaningful data summarization and robust validation, the pipeline delivers high-quality, relevant information directly aligned with user needs.

## How It Works

1. **User Input**: The user provides a `search_term`, initiating the pipeline.
2. **Query Creation**: The input is transformed into a formatted query suitable for the search engine.
3. **Query Validation**: The generated query is checked for quality before it proceeds to the next stage.
4. **Search Execution**: The query is sent to the search engine, which returns a list of web results.
5. **Result Validation**: The results are validated to ensure relevance. If they do not meet the criteria, the flow is halted.
6. **Data Processing**: Validated results are further processed as necessary, preparing them for summarization.
7. **Summarization**: The processed results are condensed into a user-friendly summary.
8. **Output**: The finalized summary is returned to the user, completing the process.
